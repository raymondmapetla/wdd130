            <p>Hello, I am Mpho Raymond Mapetla from Maseru in the mountain kingdom of Lesotho. I was 
            raised by a single mother of two children and I have been a member of the church of Jesus 
            Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 20 years. I am very excited to be a WDD 130 student. I love 
            playing and producing music a lot. I spend most of my free time on a computer that is why I 
            decided to pursue a degree in Software Development.</p>
