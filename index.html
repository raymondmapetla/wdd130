            <p>Hello, I am Mpho Raymond Mapetla from Maseru in the mountain kingdom of Lesotho. 
                I was raised by a single mother of two children and I have been a member of the 
                church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 20 years. I am very excited to be 
                a WDD 130 student. I love playing and producing music a lot. I spend most of my free 
                time on a computer that is why I decided to pursue a degree in Software Development.</p>
